The point of this challenge was to refactor a website that wasn't following accessibiltiy standards. This was achieved by changing some of the elements to a more semantic tags and in repostioning in a more logical, chronological order. Also adding alt attributes to the pictures.

## Description


## Examples
Refactored HTML to include semantic elements (ex.header,nav)
```html
 <header class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
```

Consolidated CSS selectors by applying the same class to multiple HMTL elements
```css
.services {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
    height: 300px;
    font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
    background-color: #0072bb;
    color: #ffffff;
}

```
